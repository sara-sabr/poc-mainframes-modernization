# Mainframe

This project will host a proof of concept of a mainframe being converted to latest technologies. This will ensure sufficient knowledge before investigating solutions to address the migration path forward and addresses security concerns when trying to test solutions available.

## Goals

1. Build a mainframe application.
2. Migrate the mainframe application through as per [patterns](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/enterprise-strategy/yes-you-should-modernize-your-mainframe-with-the-cloud/):
    - Emulation in cloud (Lift and shift)
    - Automate solution conversion (Forward-engineering)
    - Augmentation with Data Analytics/New Channels
3. Analyze the impacts after the conversion
4. Move onto a complex workload to truely try the solutions (not opensourced)
